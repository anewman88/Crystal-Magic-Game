Homework Assignment 4 - unit-4-game
SMU Programming Bootcamp Spring 2019

The purpose of the program is a Crystal Magic Game.  The game display shows 4 
crystals and a Target number between 19 and 120. Each crystal has been randomly
assigned a value between 1 and 12.  Each time the player clicks on a crystal, 
the value assigned to the crystal is added to a running total counter.  The 
object of the game is to match his/her running total to the target number. The
player has the choice at any time to reset the current game and start over, or
to start a brand new game.  The game keeps track of wins and losses.  If a player
reset the game it does not count toward either a win or loss.

## Installation
The program is started as a "normal" html file: html.index. No "installation" needed
